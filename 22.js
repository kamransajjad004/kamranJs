// Loops
/* 
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly
as long as a condition is true.
They help avoid writing the same code multiple times.

// There r two types of loops
//1. Basic loops
//2. Advanced loops

// Basic loop ==> for loop,while loop, do while loop
*/

//for loop:
//runs a block of code a specific number of times.

// Synatx for ..for loop
//         1          2          4
// for(initialize),condition,increment)
// {      3
// code to repeat
//}

//1. initialize ==> where to start
//2. condition checks always for true to execute code block
//3. code block (what to repeat)
//4. increment the number

for (let i = 3; i <=5; i++){
    console.log("hello cfi");
}
